Name of script:
wfl32_assignment-2_customCube.py

Function:
There are 5 total inputs. They are the cube's width, the cube's height, the cube's depth, the designated file's directory path, and the file's name.

Your input should look something like this:
10 26 76 C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Desktop\ customCube_v01

This will create a cube with those 3 numbers as its dimensions as (WIDTH, HEIGHT, DEPTH) in Maya. It will then save it to a Mata file to wherever the file path you set it to under whatever name you set it to.
